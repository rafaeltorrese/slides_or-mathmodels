\begin{frame}{Deletion Of A Variable}{}
  \begin{itemize} \justifying \parskip3mm
  \item Deletion of a \alert{non-basic variable} is a totally superflous operation and does not affect the feasibility or optimality of the current optimal solution.
  \item Deletion of a \alert{basic variable} may affect the optimality and a new optimum solution may have to be found out.
  \item A \alert{heavy penalty} $-M$ ($+M$ for minimization problems) is assigned to the variable under consideration and the new optimum solution is obtained by \alert{applying regular simplex method} to the (modified) current optimum table.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frameExample}{09.}{}
  Consider the optimal solution of \hyperlink{example08}{example 08} when a new  constratint was added. If product $B$ is not to be produced, so that variable $x_2$ is to be deleted from this table, find the optimum solution to the resulting L.P. problem.
