    Consider the following problem faced by a production planner in a soft drink plant. He has two bottling machines $A$ and $B$. $A$ is designed for 8-ounce bottles and $B$ for 16-ounce bottles. However; each can be used on both types of Bottles with som loss of efficiency. The following data are available:%

    \begin{onlyenv}<1>
  {\centering
      \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      \toprule
      Machine&8-ounce bottles&16-ounce bottles \\
      \midrule
      $A$&100/minute&40/minute \\
      $B$&60/minute&75/minute\\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \par}
  \end{onlyenv}

  The machines can be run 8-hour per day, 5 days a week. Profit on 8-ounce bottle is 15 paise and on 16-ounce bottle is 25 paise. Weekly production of the drink cannot exceed 300,000 ounces and the market can absorb 25,000 eight-ounce bottles and 7,000 sixteen-ounce bottles per week. The planner wishes to maximize his profit subject, of course, to all the production and marketing constraints. Formulate this as L.P. problem.
