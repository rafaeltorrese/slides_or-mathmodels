\section{EXAMPLE 2.6-19 (Product Mix
Problem)}\label{example-2.6-19-product-mix-problem}}

A firm manufactures two items. lt purchases castings which are then
machined, bored and polished. Castings for items A and B cost \$ 2 and
\$ 3 respectively and are sold at \$ 5 and \$ 6 each respectively.
Running costs of the three machines are \$ 20, \$ 14 and \$ 17.50 per
hour respectively. Capacities of the machines are

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
& Part \(A\) & Part \(B\) \\
\midrule
\endhead
Machine capacity & 25/hr & 40/hr \\
Boring capacity & 28/hr & 35/hr \\
Polishing capacity & 25/hr & 40/hr \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Formulate the L.P. model to determine the product mix that maximizes the
profit.
