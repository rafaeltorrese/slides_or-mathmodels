\begin{frameExample}{Product Mix Problem}{}
  A manufacturer has five lathes and three milling machines in his workshop and produces and assembly that consists of 2 units of part A and 3 units of part B. The processing time for each part on the two types of machines is given below.

  {
    \centering
    \scalebox{0.9}{%
      \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \toprule
        Part&\multicolumn{2}{c}{Processing time in minutes on a} \\
        \cmidrule{2-3}
            &Lathe&Milling machine \\
        \midrule
        A&10&18 \\
        B&25&12\\
        \toprule
      \end{tabular}
    }
    \par
  }

  In order to maintain a uniform work-load on the two types of machines, the manufacturer has framed a policy that no type of machine should run more than 40 minutes per day longer than the other machine. Formulate the L.P. problem if the objective is to produce the maximum number of assemblies in any 8-hour working day.
