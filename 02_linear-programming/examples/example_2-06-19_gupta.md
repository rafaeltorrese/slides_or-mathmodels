A firm  manufactures  two  items.  lt purchases  castings  which  are  then  machined,  bored  and polished.  Castings for  items A  and B cost \$  2  and \$   3  respectively  and are  sold at  \$  5  and \$  6  each  respectively.  Running costs  of  the  three  machines  are  \$  20,  \$   14  and \$   17.50 per hour  respectively.  Capacities  of  the  machines  are 

| | Part $A$ | Part $B$|
| ---- | ---- | ----|
