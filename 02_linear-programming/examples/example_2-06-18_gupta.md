# EXAMPLE  2.6-18  (Product  Mix  Problem) 

A firm produces  three  different products,  1,  2  and 3.  Each product needs  to  be processed through  two  departments,  $A$ and $B$.  Department $A$  has  two  machines $A_1$  and $A_2$,  while $B$ has  three machines,  $B_1$,  $B_2$  and $B_3$.  Product  1  can  be  manufactured  on  any  type  of  $A$  and $B$ machines. Product 2  can  be  manufactured  on  any  of  type  $A$  machines  and only  on  $B$ 1  of  type  $B$  machines. Product  3  can  be  manufactured  on  machines  $A_2$  of  type  $A$  and  $B_3$  of  type  $B$.  Time  taken  to manufacture  one  unit of  each  of  product  on  each  type  of  machine  is  given  in  table  below.  The table  also  shows  total  available  machine  time per  week,  cost  of  running  each  machine  at full capacity  in  a  week,  cost  of  raw  material  required per  unit product  and  sale  price  per  unit product.  How  many  of  each  type  of  product  be  manufactured  on  which  machine  so  as  to maximize  the  net profit  ?  Formulate  the  L.P.  model for  the problem. 

Machine| 1 | 2 | 3 | Time per week (minutes)| Cost / week at full capacity
-----| ----- | ----- | ----- | -----| -----
A1|4|5|--|5,000|250

B1|7|8|--|8,000|450
B2|8|--|--|4,000|250
